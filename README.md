# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.


## Results: 
__Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.__
1. Naive Random Sampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Undersampling
4. Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
5. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
6. Easy Ensemble Classifier


## Summary: 
__Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.__
